          6. Use of Google Analytics
        </h2>
        <p className='!mb-4'>
          Auto Refresh Plus uses Google Analytics to collect information about
          your use of the extension. Google Analytics collects information such
          as how often users visit the extension, what pages they visit, and
          what other sites they used prior to coming to the extension. We use
          the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our extension
          and services. <br /> <br /> Google Analytics collects only the IP
          address assigned to you on the date you use the extension, rather than
          your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
          information collected through the use of Google Analytics with
          personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants
          a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique
          user the next time you use the extension, the cookie cannot be used by
          anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information
          collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the extension is
          restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy
          Policy.
